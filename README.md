The Amazon Kindle Store Reviews Analysis project aims to address the challenge of analysing customer reviews in the Amazon Kindle StoreAs an e-commerce platform for e-books, the Kindle Store relies on customer feedback to improve its products and provide a better user experience. However, there is often a disconnect between the content of customer reviews and the assigned ratings. Many customers either forget to rate the product or do not engage with the rating system. This inconsistency makes it difficult to accurately determine the sentiment expressed in the reviews solely based on the assigned ratings.
The project suggests using natural language processing methods to conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews in order to get around this problem. The practise of identifying the sentiment or attitude indicated in a document is known as sentiment analysis, commonly referred to as opinion mining. Businesses can learn a lot about the advantages and disadvantages of their goods, spot opportunities for improvement, and base decisions on client feedback by analysing user opinions.
The Amazon Kindle Store Reviews Analysis project specifically focuses on developing a sentiment analysis system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. LSTM models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that excel at analysing sequential data, such as text. These models have been widely used in natural language processing tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and understand the context of words in a sentence.
